# opencv-stabilization-demo

A video stabilization demo using openCV and vidStab with python.
This mainly involves reducing the effect of motion due to shaking, rotation or any movement in camera.
In this, a video stabilization library is used, because it is adequate for motion stabilization.

# Main properties
This demonstration is aimed mainly at webcams for desktop  or laptop, but can be easily be used with previously captured video by webcam, smartphone, camera etc.
It also extrapolates the data of the trejectory for the stabilized video and the transformation it performs, to use for analisys at a later stage.
The output video is shown side by side with the raw input video, and saved in the same manner as output.avi.
